# AIETHOS Framework

**Practical Framework for Ethical AI Use in Organizations**

AIETHOS is a governance framework for organizations that use third-party AI tools without building their own models. It provides three core templates and a structured set of practices to ensure responsible AI adoption at any scale — from a solo founder to a growing company without a compliance department. Three documents + one role. Implements in 2 hours.
