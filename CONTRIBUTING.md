# Contributing to AIETHOS

AIETHOS is a framework of templates and practices. Contributions are documents, translations, and real-world adaptations.

## What you can contribute

- **Industry variants** — adapted templates for specific sectors (healthcare, HR, education, legal). Add as a new file alongside the core template, e.g. `ai_check_hr.md`.
- **Translations** — full translations of templates and docs into other languages.
- **Integrations** — practical notes on using AIETHOS with specific tools (Notion, Airtable, Confluence).
- **Corrections** — factual errors, outdated regulatory references, clarity improvements.

## One rule

Every contribution must stay implementable by a non-specialist. Before submitting, ask: *Can a small business owner read this and act on it today?*

## How to submit

For small changes: fork, edit, open a Pull Request with a one-line description of what and why.

For larger additions (new variant, full translation): open an Issue first to align on scope.
